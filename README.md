# JS-Projects
This repository consists of the list of js projects.
There are two files named first and second.
First named file is the completed source code of that project similar to second project but may have
different source code some may be similar.
First file is for reference and second file is for practice so that you dont have to undo the things you lost.
Happy coding.
